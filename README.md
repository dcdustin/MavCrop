MavCrop
==========

MavSuggest is an autocomplete (or text suggestion) mootools library which is able to query it's results from a server-side script, or a local cache of JSON objects. The server-side script results can also be cached to allow for both a faster result, and less server traffic. 

There are many options to customize the text field and the search results to match the look and feel of your web-site or web application. Keyboard and mouse interactions make it as intuitive as using any other form field. Effects are optional for an even quicker response and display time.
